As a CTO of a small startup, I have severals responsabilities, ranging from product development, architecture and management.\newline
I like to be hands on, strongly believe that a project can only succeed by setting up good \textbf{culture, collaboration, process and communication} between team members

My backgroup is mainly as a Senior Software Engineer with 15 years of experience using mainly \textbf{Python} but also Java, Scala and \textbf{Golang}.\newline
Having worked with a wide range of framework and technologies, I have an extensive experience in software design.\newline
\textbf{Startups} environment is what suit me best, I am also a \textbf{remote worker} since 2018.
