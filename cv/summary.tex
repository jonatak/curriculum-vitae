Today I am a manager, a scrum master, a CTO and also a developer.\newline
I like to be hands on, strongly believe that a project can only succeed by setting up good \textbf{culture, collaboration, process and communication} between team members
I strongly believe in Remote Work as it promote a good life balance and less stressful environment which help for a more productive team.

But I am a Senior Software Engineer with 15 years of experience using mainly \textbf{Python} but also Java, Scala and \textbf{Golang}.\newline
Having worked with a wide range of framework and tech, I have an extensive experience in software design.\newline
I believe in Micro-Services oriented architecture, functional programming and I'm always up to a challenge.\newline
\textbf{Startups} environment is what suit me best, I am also a \textbf{remote worker} since 2018.

Also I have a keen interest in behavioural science, I was a professional dog trainer for a little while.
