As a CTO with over 15 years of experience in software engineering and architecture, I bring a rare blend of technical depth, ethical leadership, and hands-on development in \textbf{Python, Golang}, and modern distributed systems.
My expertise spans cloud-native architecture, real-time data platforms, team management, and product development.

In my most recent role at ZYTLYN, I built and led a fully remote, international engineering team, defined our engineering culture, and co-led product strategy and execution.

I enjoy staying hands-on and firmly believe that successful projects are rooted in \textbf{strong culture}, collaboration, clear processes, and open communication.

I thrive in environments where engineering isn’t just about writing code—but about building resilient systems, healthy teams, and a culture of \textbf{trust, mutual respect, and shared ownership}.

Whether working as a \textbf{Principal Engineer} or a \textbf{senior technical partner}, I bring a strong bias for action, thoughtful collaboration, and sustainable delivery.
