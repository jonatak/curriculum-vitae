I am an experienced software developer with 7 years of experiences using mainly Java and Python, with strong skills in architecture and conception.
I start using Scala 2 years ago and fall in love with functional programming, I started using it more and more, and looked deeper in functional programming and other language like Haskell to have a better understanding of all those concept in functional programming that was new for me at that time.
I want to keep learning and improving with functional programming and its differents applications.
