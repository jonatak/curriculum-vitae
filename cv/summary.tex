%---------------------------------------------------------
Hands-on engineer and technical leader with 15+ years of experience building \textbf{distributed systems, data platforms, and cloud-native products}.

I combine deep technical expertise with a collaborative, \textbf{values-driven} approach, focused on building resilient architectures and healthy engineering cultures.

My strength lies in building resilient systems while helping create environments grounded in \textbf{trust, respect, and collaboration} â€” where both people and technology can thrive sustainably.

I care deeply about guiding teams with \textbf{empathy}, setting clear technical foundations, and fostering cultures where long-term well-being matters as much as delivery.
